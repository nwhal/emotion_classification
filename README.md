# Emotion Classification: Team Lab
Welcome to the repository for our SS2022 team lab. This repository contains two folders. The first is the advanced methods portion of the project which uses BERT fine-tuning to classify emotions on the ISEAR dataset. The second is the baseline portion which uses the multi-class perceptron algorithm an TF-IDF vectorization. Instructions on running the modules and notebooks can be found in the respective README.md's for these folders.
